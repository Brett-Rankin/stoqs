Instructions for loading your data in STOQS

These instructions will cover loading in situ point observation data from
OPeNDAP accessible data sources.

1. Add a new file to the loaders directory named to describe the campaign that is 
   the source of the data.  The campaign name may be a project name or a month_year
   combination.  It can really be anything you want.  At MBARI for the CANON project
   we typically have fields programs where intensive measurements are collected in
   an area of the ocean over a several week period, so we name our campaigns like
   'sept2010' and our stoqs databases like 'stoqs_sept2010' and 'stoqs_june2011'.
   The point of using separate databases for campaigns is to constrain the size
   of the databases, which helps in managing them and in evolving stoqs applications
   while maintaining some level of consistent functionality of access for databases
   that are not under development.
   
2. In your new loadXXXX.py file instantiate a DAPloaders object with accurate attributes
   for each activity to be loaded.  There are several examples of other load files in
   the loaders/ directory.  Feel free to use them as a basis for the data you wish to load.
   
3. Execute your load script.

4. Notes:

	- Use the stride attribute to subsample data to be loaded if the density is too great
	  for the purpose of your database
	- Update the comment on the Activity after the load to provide useful information about
	  the Activity.  The showActivities view code uses the comment to render a useful web
	  response.
